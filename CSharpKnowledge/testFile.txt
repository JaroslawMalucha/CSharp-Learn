In C#, arguments can be passed to parameters either by value or by reference. Passing by reference enables function members, methods, properties, indexers, operators, and constructors to change the value of the parameters and have that change persist in the calling environment. To pass a parameter by reference, use the ref or out keyword. For simplicity, only the ref keyword is used in the examples in this topic. For more information about the difference between ref and out, see ref, out, and Passing Arrays Using ref and out.
